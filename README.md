# SchoolProject-OverwatchHeroList
A little project to learn how to use C# 

As part of the Hackathon 2018 of the HEH Computer Science section, this project will focus on the development of a program to manage a data library.

This library will have for subject: "The Heroes of Overwatch".

The goal is to perfect our mastery of manipulations in object-oriented programming. In order to do so, we will follow the instructions established by our teachers and incorporate the different instructions into our project.

The goal of this project will be to create a program that will allow the creation of character (or "Hero") cards. The consultation of these cards as well as their updates and eventual deletion (in case of patch by the creators of the game).
